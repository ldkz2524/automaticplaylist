automaticplaylist
=================

Gathers a list of musics from a website and converts them into Youtube Playlist

There are some open sourced libraries i have used, but i will update the details of such after i finish the program to some degree

Remaining Works:
	Adding songs back to youtube playlist
	Interfaces to be made for parser, crawler, retriever for maintainability
	documentation for future uses

Know issues:
	Parsing is still an issue for some songs (more testing needed)
		- Minimum information is always the best
	Song not getting found for in the first search page (adam levine - lost stars)
		- I think there is a song that should have been found.
